                            no event be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary

                            damages. In jurisdictions where the exclusion or limitation of liability for
                            consequential or incidental damages is not allowed the liability of FlappCards is limited
                            to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
